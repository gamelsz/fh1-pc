# Forza Horizon (2012) PC (XC)

Here's complete Forza Horizon 1 project for PC preconfigured for the best experience. It's running through Xenia Canary emulator and is almost completely Plug&Play and comes with all DLC's preinstalled + almost 100% gamesave with 10 millions credits (real savegame, not edited). No sketchy/suspicious .bat or .exe files were included in this repo, just a straight up configured game so a little of work have to be done.

## 1. How to run the game?
1. Copy the whole folder named "Forza Horizon" somewhere on your disk. Create a shortcut of "xenia_canary.exe" and place it on your desktop.
2. Run the Xenia Canary shortcut and click CTRL+O, then select the file named "FH1.iso" from your "Forza Horizon" folder.
3. Create a gamer profile if necessary and enjoy the game!

## 2. Known problems
1. Usually once in a hour the game MAY crash due to XMA Decoding error. It's related to sound bugs. If it occurs just restart the game.
2. There's no motion blur effect around nearby of the player's car. I haven't found a working fix yet, it's a rather cosmetic problem.
3. If the game seems blurry you may need to manually run the Xenia with 8x/16x filtering. This as well as AMD FSR can be configured through Xenia, but I suggest to use the outside option.
4. If your controller doesn't work properly/at all you have to run "x360ce.exe" and Auto-Map the controller bindings, so the controller will work properly.

## 3. Technicals (not important)
1. The game's version is v.x.04 (the newest) and works completely fine with Horizon Rally DLC. It has been patched manually and can be found in Title Updates folders, as well as all other installed DLC's.
2. Config file is located in main folder and was configured for E5-1650v3 and GTX970. If you have more powerful PC you might want to use resolution scale 16 (FHD) instead of default 8 (720p).
3. Sound sampling is in its sweet spot, it may crash sometimes though.
4. Game comes with applied Patches, as well as the basic patch for FH2.
5. VSYNC is turned on and game is locked 60fps (due to my harware limits), so there's no UI flickering. If have way more powerful PC you might want to play with the settings a bit.
